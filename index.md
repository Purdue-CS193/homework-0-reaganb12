# Reagan's First CS193 Homework

My favorite things about CS193 (so far)
 - I think we will learn some skills that will genuinely be useful in the future
 - My friend Julie is in the class
 - I like having teachers who are students
 - The humor on the slide shows
 - The creative names for folders/files/etc :)
